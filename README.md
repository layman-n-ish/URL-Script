# URL-Script
A script to open the links from a .txt file onto your default browser in individual tabs.

Proves useful in cases of unfinished business on the browser; instead of hassling through your browser history to restore the undone work, before quitting, just copy done the URLs and let the script do the rest of the work for you!

How to use:
python3 url_script.py -l "link_to_text_file"
